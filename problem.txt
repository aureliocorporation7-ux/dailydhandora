I have fixed the critical revalidation error. The issue was caused by an incorrect URL construction in the `run-bot.js` script, which was sending the revalidation request to the application's homepage instead of the designated `/api/revalidate` endpoint. I have corrected the code to ensure the revalidation URL is always correctly formed. I have also removed the `history.txt` file.
